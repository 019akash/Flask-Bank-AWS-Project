    *   **Database:** AWS DynamoDB (NoSQL Database)
    *   **Identity & Access Management:** AWS IAM
*   **Backend Framework:** Python Flask
*   **Database Interaction (Python):** `boto3` (AWS SDK for Python)
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Security:** `werkzeug.security` (for password hashing)
*   **Data Types:** UUIDs for IDs, ISO format for timestamps, DynamoDB Decimal for monetary values.

## High-Level Architecture

*(This section would ideally include an architecture diagram image. The description below summarizes it.)*

The system follows a multi-tier architecture:

1.  **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript render the user interface, interacting with the backend via HTTP requests.
2.  **Application Layer (Backend):** A Flask application hosted on AWS EC2 handles business logic, API endpoints, user authentication, session management, and orchestrates database operations.
3.  **Data Persistence Layer (Database):** AWS DynamoDB stores all user data, account information, and transaction records. It's designed with appropriate primary keys and Global Secondary Indexes for efficient querying.
4.  **AWS Services:** IAM manages permissions for EC2 instances and other services to interact securely.

## Project Flow & Milestones

The project was developed through the following key phases:

1.  **AWS Account & IAM Setup:** Configuring the foundational AWS environment and security.
2.  **DynamoDB Design & Setup:** Defining table schemas (`users`, `transactions`), primary keys, GSIs, and implementing Python (`boto3`) scripts for table creation and helper functions.
3.  **EC2 Instance Launch & Configuration:** Setting up the EC2 instance, security groups, and ensuring connectivity to DynamoDB.
4.  **Flask Backend Development:** Implementing API endpoints for user registration, authentication, and banking transactions, integrating with DynamoDB.
5.  **HTML/CSS/JS Frontend Development:** Creating the user interface pages for all banking operations and connecting them to the Flask backend.
6.  **Deployment, Testing & Optimization:** Deploying the Flask app to EC2, conducting thorough testing (functional, security, load), and optimizing performance.

## Setup and Deployment

*(This section provides a high-level guide. Detailed commands are in the project documentation.)*

1.  **AWS Prerequisites:**
    *   An active AWS account.
    *   IAM user with necessary permissions for EC2, DynamoDB, and IAM management.
    *   AWS CLI configured (optional, for command-line management).

2.  **DynamoDB Setup:**
    *   Create `users` and `transactions` tables in DynamoDB as per the schema defined in the project (partition keys, sort keys, GSIs, attribute definitions). This can be done via the AWS Console, AWS CLI, or programmatically using the provided Python scripts (if available in the repo).
    *   Ensure tables have appropriate ProvisionedThroughput settings (or use On-Demand capacity).

3.  **EC2 Instance Setup & Application Deployment:**
    *   Launch an EC2 instance (e.g., Amazon Linux 2 AMI, `t2.micro` for testing).
    *   Configure Security Groups to allow HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22) traffic.
    *   Assign an IAM Role to the EC2 instance with permissions to access DynamoDB.
    *   SSH into the EC2 instance.
    *   Install Python 3, pip, and `virtualenv`.
    *   Create a virtual environment and activate it.
    *   Clone this repository onto the EC2 instance.
    *   Install Python dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install Flask boto3 werkzeug # Add other dependencies if any
        ```
    *   Configure any necessary environment variables (e.g., AWS region, table names if not hardcoded).
    *   Run the Flask application:
        ```bash
        python app.py # Or your main application file
        ```
    *   For production, consider using a production-grade WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI behind a web server like Nginx.

4.  **Accessing the Application:**
    *   Access the application via the EC2 instance's public IP address or a configured domain name in your web browser.

## Usage

Once deployed, users can:

1.  **Register** for a new account.
2.  **Login** to their existing account.
3.  View their **Account Dashboard** with balance and recent activity.
4.  **Deposit** funds into their account.
5.  **Withdraw** funds from their account.
6.  **Transfer** funds to other registered users.
7.  View their detailed **Transaction History/Statements**.
8.  **Logout** securely.

The analytics and reporting features are conceptualized to be built upon this core banking data, accessible to authorized bank personnel (e.g., fraud analysts, financial managers, compliance officers) through specialized interfaces or dashboards (development of these specific UIs might be part of future enhancements).

## Security Considerations

*   **Password Hashing:** `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash` is used for storing user passwords.
*   **Session Management:** Flask sessions are used to manage user login states.
*   **Input Validation:** Implemented at the application level for forms and API inputs.
*   **IAM Roles & Permissions:** Least privilege principles applied for AWS resource access.
*   **HTTPS:** Recommended for production deployment to encrypt data in transit.
*   **DynamoDB Security:** Access controlled via IAM roles; consider encryption at rest.

## Future Enhancements

*   [ ] **Advanced Analytics Dashboards:** Develop dedicated UIs for real-time transaction monitoring, custom reporting, and compliance tracking.
*   [ ] **Integration with AWS Analytics Services:** Utilize services like Amazon Kinesis for real-time data streaming, AWS Lambda for serverless processing, and Amazon QuickSight or SageMaker for advanced analytics and machine learning (e.g., fraud detection models).
*   [ ] **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enhance user account security.
*   [ ] **Email/SMS Notifications:** For transactions and security alerts.
*   [ ] **API Gateway & Lambda:** Transition parts of the backend to a serverless architecture for better scalability and cost-efficiency.
*   [ ] **Containerization:** Dockerize the application and deploy using services like AWS ECS or EKS.
*   [ ] **Automated Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate the build, test, and deployment process using AWS CodePipeline or similar tools.
